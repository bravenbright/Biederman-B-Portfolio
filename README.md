This is a single-page application portfolio for a web developer, built using React. The application includes a header, a section for content, and a footer, and meets the following acceptance criteria:

Acceptance Criteria
When the portfolio is loaded, users are presented with a header, a section for content, and a footer.
When users view the header, they are presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
When users view the navigation titles, they are presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
When users click on a navigation title, they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
When users load the portfolio the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default.
When users are presented with the About Me section, they see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
When users are presented with the Portfolio section, they see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.
When users are presented with the Contact section, they see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
When users move their cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, they receive a notification that this field is required.
When users enter text into the email address field, they receive a notification if they have entered an invalid email address.
When users are presented with the Resume section, they see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
When users view the footer, they are presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
